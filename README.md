# DUPLICLEAN
Data de-duplication refers to the removal of duplicate data in a database or cloud storage.
Data duplication is one of the major issues that the real world faces today. Due to the
duplication of data, huge amounts of memory space are wasted to store and manage it. This
raises the need for a system that determines duplicate data and handles it accordingly.<br/> The
project aims to develop a system that identifies duplicate data using MD5 hashing technique
and verifies data integrity using checksum method Adler32. Large datasets are divided into
data blocks of fixed size, and the MD5 hash for each data block is calculated. This MD5 hash
is used for data de-duplication. The MD5 hash is unique for each data block, and it helps
provide a higher level of accuracy for identifying unique data blocks. Incorporation of both
checksum and MD5 helps in efficient, fast, accurate and comprehensive data deduplication<br/>
